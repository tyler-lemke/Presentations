# MVP
"A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development." 
 â€” *Wikipedia (Arbiter of All Knowledge)*   
 <!-- 
    Tonight we are here because you want to build something new and
    maybe even exciting, but you might not know where to start. Our

    Scope - we will focus on a few of the technologies our there and
    get you thinking about some of the things you should consider.
    We will also demo some of the technologies as well.
 -->



# Where are you taking us?
 - Considerations
 - Landscape
 - Pros and Cons
 - Some Demos
<!--
- Dozens of Technologies
- Each Has a Different Use Case (Strengths/Weaknesses)
- Choosing the wrong one can cause lost time/capital and maybe cost your business
 -->

# What are we considering when making MVP?
 - Speed
 - Development Cost 
 - Disposable (Yes/No)
 <!-- 
 Speed - time to market
 Dev -number of devs and experience of each
 Disposable - are you going to build on this? will it be easy to do so?
 -->

 # Other Considerations
  - Security
  - Out of Box UI Components
  - Scalability
  - Platform Maturity 

  <!-- 
  Platform Maturity - How long has it been around - reverse side, is it getting long in the tooth
  -->

# Caveat Emptor
 - Not an expert
 - Its hard to compare all the platforms
 - Prototype or Die
 - Just a starting point

<!-- 

Not All Answers - Did I forget to mention I'm not an expert?

# 3 Main Types
 1. Native Solutions
     - Java / Kotlin (Android)
     - Objective C / Swift (iOS)
     - C# with Xamarin (Androis / iOS)
     
 2. Hybrid Solutions
     - Use Native Components
     - Allow You to Reuse Code

 3. WebView Solutions
     - Use phone browser
     - Allow You to Reuse Code
