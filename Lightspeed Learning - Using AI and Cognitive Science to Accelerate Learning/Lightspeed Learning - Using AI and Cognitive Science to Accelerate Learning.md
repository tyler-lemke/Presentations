## Write these down prior to the start of the talk:
1. What are the 4 pillars of learning?
Have AI create 4 more for me

# Lightspeed Learning

## AI = Problem

1. More information > More Code > More Cognitive Load
2. Skill Atrophy 





<!-- 
More frameworks
Faster release cycles
More information to handle
Add reference to amount of information and systems growing
 -->

 <!-- 
 Skill atrophy 
- code complete mentions how 50% of Dev skill is lost every 3 years
- that pace is likely to speed up
- AI tools can break some of the core tenants that allow us to both learn and retain info
- we can combat this by using AI tools to our advantage
  -->

---

## Learning = Problem
- Cramming is only effective for tests.
- Learning styles don’t improve outcomes.
- Left-/Right-brain dominance is a myth.
- You don’t use just 10% of your brain.
- Passive learning can't work
- Too much to learn
---

## AI + Science = Solution
1. Know the most effective ways to learn
2. Utilize an AI first approach with the correct tools
3. Create a learning system that guarantees success

<!-- 

Not sure If I will incorporate or not yet
## Three Main Benefits

---
1. **Breaking Down Subjects Quickly**  
   AI can help learners deconstruct complex topics into manageable parts, making it easier to get a clear overview and identify core concepts.

---

2. **Reducing Learning Friction**  
   AI adapts to each learner’s pace, accessibility needs, and motivational challenges—making learning more inclusive and less overwhelming.

---

3. **Continuous Feedback**  
   Like a personal tutor, AI offers real-time corrections and guidance, which accelerates mastery through timely error feedback.

How we learn high level

-- bottom up - first principles thinking
-- top down - neurons that fire wire

-encoding - retrieval

- you can only learn so much at once
- cognitive overload makes you dumber

if it aint hard you aren't learning
desirable difficulty is the key

## The "Effective" ways to learn

---

## Four Pillars of Learning (from *How We Learn* by Stanislas Dehaene)
1. **Attention** – Filter out distractions and focus on relevant input.
2. **Active Engagement** – Learners must actively explore and practice.
3. **Error Feedback** – Mistakes help refine understanding.
4. **Consolidation** – Sleep and repetition reinforce learning.

## Attention
- Multitasking is a myth
- Passive learning during sleep doesn't work
- 

---

## Active Engagement

- Write notes while learning
- Ask questions

---

## Error Feedback

- Tutors/Mentors
- Fast Feedback Loops Rock
- A cool hack is to rate confidence level then get feedback - helps remember better

---

## Consolidation

 - Things that were once hard become automatic
 - Neuron groupings physically get closer together

---

## Learning Strategies (from *Understanding How We Learn*)
- **Elaboration** – Explain ideas in your own words.
- **Concrete Examples** – Use real-life, relatable scenarios.
- **Dual Coding** – Combine visuals and text.
- **Spaced Practice** – Space out learning over time.
- **Interleaving** – Mix related topics to deepen understanding.
- **Retrieval Practice** – Practice recalling instead of re-reading.

## Elaboration
"Adding details to memories and integrating new information with existing knowledge." - Understanding How We Learn

---

## Concrete Examples
"Specific stories, pictures, analogies, and other items that illustrate abstract ideas." - Understanding How We Learn

---

## Dual Coding
"Combining words with visuals." - Understanding How We Learn

--

## Spaced Practice
" Having multiple opportunities to study or practice something at two distinct time-points." - Understanding How We Learn

- Most backed by current studies
- Closer to the real thing the better - coding (type out code), presenting (give a talk) etc

---

## Interleaving
" Switching between ideas or problem types while studying." - Understanding How We Learn
- interrupts the short term memory caching
- creates "desirable difficulty"

---

## Retrieval Practice
"Bringing learned information to mind from long-term memory." -  Understanding How We Learn

- Just attempting to do so increases learning
- Non-intuitive and feels like you are failing but works
- Most backed by current studies

## Core Concept
**AI-First Learning**: Using AI as a tutor—not to do the work for you, but to help you iterate, think critically, and engage deeply with the material.

---
## Pitfalls of AI-First Learning
- **Over-reliance on Automation**  
  Without self-monitoring and active thinking, learners may disengage or misunderstand the material.

- **False Fluency**  
  AI might make learning feel too easy. It's crucial to build in desirable difficulty and test real understanding.


## Takeaway

Get out a notebook and write down:

1. What are you going to learn?
 - Think 80/20
  - Mental Models
  - Facts
  - Heuristics
  - Syntax
  - Quotes
  - 10,000 foot view
  - Everything about a niche topic
  - The right questions to ask?

  What do you need to learn vs what to outsource to AI?

  Is the syntax important?
  Is understanding key principles important?
  Is knowledge sharing important?
2. What tools are you going to use to learn it?
3. What are you going to avoid learning or consuming?
  - Create a simple rule for yourself, a huristic
  - Grading information on a 1-10 scale for relevance to job long term

4. What system will you put in place to master this subject?

---

## Systematize
---
## Super Simple System 1

1. What are you going to learn
Cognitive biases and fallacies
2. Tools - NotebookLM and habit app

---
DEMO time

- load the pdf
  - encoding
- start with 10000 foot top down view - creating audio or just read through
- elaboration

- retrieval
---

## Goldilocks System?
---

## Complex System

- **Knowledge and Experience Profile**  
  Envisioning AI that builds a personalized learning map using your prior knowledge, experiences, and interests.


---


---

## Closing

- Time and Attention are our most precious resources
- How are you going to spend it?
