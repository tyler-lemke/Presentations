## AI = Problem

1. More information > More Code > More Cognitive Load
2. Skill Atrophy due to the Time Machine Effect (add time machine image)

<!-- 
More frameworks
Faster release cycles
More information to handle
Add reference to amount of information and systems growing
 -->

 <!-- 
 Skill atrophy 
- code complete mentions how 50% of Dev skill is lost every 3 years
- that pace is likely to speed up
- AI tools can break some of the core tenants that allow us to both learn and retain info
- we can combat this by using AI tools to our advantage
  -->

## AI + Science = Solution
1. Need to know how learn effectively
2. Use AI tools to help us nail this down faster

## Cognitive Science to the Rescue

--- 
## Learning myths can hurt us
- Learning styles don’t improve outcomes.
- Left-/Right-brain dominance is a myth.
- You don’t use just 10% of your brain.
- Passive learning can work
---

## Cognitive Science Principles (from *Understanding How We Learn*)
- **Elaboration** – Explain ideas in your own words.
- **Concrete Examples** – Use real-life, relatable scenarios.
- **Dual Coding** – Combine visuals and text.
- **Spaced Practice** – Space out learning over time.
- **Interleaving** – Mix related topics to deepen understanding.
- **Retrieval Practice** – Practice recalling instead of re-reading.

## Four Pillars of Learning (from *How We Learn* by Stanislas Dehaene)
1. **Attention** – Filter out distractions and focus on relevant input.
2. **Active Engagement** – Learners must actively explore and practice.
3. **Error Feedback** – Mistakes help refine understanding.
4. **Consolidation** – Sleep and repetition reinforce learning.

## Tools

## Core Concept
**AI-First Learning**: Using AI as a tutor—not to do the work for you, but to help you iterate, think critically, and engage deeply with the material.

---

## Three Main Benefits

---
1. **Breaking Down Subjects Quickly**  
   AI can help learners deconstruct complex topics into manageable parts, making it easier to get a clear overview and identify core concepts.

---

2. **Reducing Learning Friction**  
   AI adapts to each learner’s pace, accessibility needs, and motivational challenges—making learning more inclusive and less overwhelming.

---

3. **Continuous Feedback**  
   Like a personal tutor, AI offers real-time corrections and guidance, which accelerates mastery through timely error feedback.

---


---
## Pitfalls of AI-First Learning
- **Over-reliance on Automation**  
  Without self-monitoring and active thinking, learners may disengage or misunderstand the material.

- **False Fluency**  
  AI might make learning feel too easy. It's crucial to build in desirable difficulty and test real understanding.

## Takeaway

Get out a notebook and write down:

1. What are you going to learn?
2. What tools are you going to use to learn it?
3. What are you going to avoid learning or consuming?
<!-- 
What do you need to learn vs what to outsource to AI?

Is the syntax important?
Is understanding key principles important?
Is knowledge sharing important?

What to learn
What to avoid learning
80/20 of learning
 -->
4. What system will you put in place to master this subject?

## Closing

- Time and Attention are our most precious resources
- How are you going to spend it?
